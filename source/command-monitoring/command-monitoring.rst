Specification
=============

The performance monitoring specification defines a set of behaviour in the drivers for providing runtime information about commands to any 3rd party APM library as well internal driver use, such as logging.

-----------
Definitions
-----------

META
----

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.


Terms
-----

Document
  The term ``Document`` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a BSON document.

GLE
  The term "GLE" refers to a ``getLastError`` command.


--------
Guidance
--------

Documentation
-------------

The documentation provided in code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required documentation for the driver.


Operations
----------

All drivers MUST implement the API. Implementation details are noted in the comments when a specific implementation is required. Within each API, all methods are REQUIRED unless noted otherwise in the comments.


Operation Parameters
--------------------

All drivers MUST include the specified parameters in each operation, with the exception of the options parameter which is OPTIONAL.


Naming
------

All drivers MUST name operations, parameters and topic names as defined in the following sections. Exceptions to this rule are noted in the appropriate section. Class and interface names may vary according to the driver and language best practices.


Publishing & Subscribing
------------------------

The driver SHOULD publish events in a manner that is standard to the driver's language publish/subscribe patterns and is not strictly mandated in this specification.


Guarantees
----------

The driver MUST guarantee that every ``CommandStartedEvent`` has either a correlating ``CommandSucceededEvent`` or ``CommandFailedEvent``.


Unacknowledged/Acknowledged Writes
----------------------------------

For server versions that do not support write commands, the driver MUST treat an acknowledged write as a single command event, where the GLE command is ignored as a started event and the response to the GLE is treated as the reply in the ``CommandSucceededEvent``. Unacknowledged writes must provide a ``CommandSucceededEvent`` with a ``null`` reply.


Error Handling
--------------

If an exception occurs while sending the operation to the server, the driver MUST generate a ``CommandFailedEvent`` with the exception or message and re-raise the exception.

If the response from the server completes but contains an error, the driver MUST generate a ``CommandFailedEvent`` with the error or message from the server instead of a ``CommandSucceededEvent``. This includes ``{ ok: 0 }`` command responses and replies with query_failure flags.

    /**
     * Returns the execution time of the event in the highest possible resolution for the platform.
     * The calculated value MUST be the time to send the message and receive the reply from the server,
     * including BSON serialization and deserialization. The name can imply the units in which the
     * value is returned, i.e. durationMS, durationNanos.

Examples
--------

A Ruby subscriber to a query series and how it could handle it with respect to logging.

Ruby:

.. code:: ruby

  class LoggingSubscriber

    def started(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} STARTED: #{event.command_args.inspect}")
    end

    def succeeded(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} COMPLETED: #{event.command_reply.inspect} (#{event.duration}s)")
    end

    def failed(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} FAILED: #{event.message.inspect} (#{event.duration}s)")
    end
  end

  subscriber = LoggingSubscriber.new
  Mongo::Monitoring::Global.subscribe(Mongo::Monitoring::COMMAND, subscriber)

  # When the subscriber handles the events the log could show:
  # COMMAND.query 127.0.0.1:27017 STARTED: { $query: { name: 'testing' }}
  # COMMAND.query 127.0.0.1:27017 COMPLETED: { number_returned: 50 } (0.050s)
